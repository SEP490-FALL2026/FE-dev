# SaaS-Sentry Web architecture

Status: accepted foundation, 2026-08-11.

## Context

SaaS-Sentry is an enterprise system for SaaS catalog, contracts, license seats,
approval workflows, usage optimization, finance reporting, and Shadow IT review.
Its BRD identifies a responsive web application as the MVP and explicitly excludes
a mobile application from the current product scope.

The frontend started from the React Router welcome template. This architecture is
deliberately a modular frontend inside one deployable application: a five-person,
fourteen-week MVP does not benefit from micro-frontends, a cross-platform UI package,
or a generic repository layer over a generated HTTP client.

## Runtime view

```text
Browser
  -> static React Router SPA
      -> route module
          -> feature UI/workflow
              -> generated TanStack Query hook
                  -> fetch /api/*
                      -> NestJS REST API
```

The browser owns presentation, navigation, and ephemeral interaction state. NestJS
owns validation, authorization, workflow transitions, audit trails, persistence,
and all decisions that affect money or access.

## Key decisions

### React Router Framework Mode as an SPA

`react-router.config.ts` sets `ssr: false`. Framework Mode remains valuable for
typed route modules, route discovery, code splitting, metadata, and loader/action
orchestration. SSR is not needed for the authenticated enterprise MVP, and a single
NestJS backend avoids splitting authorization and operational ownership across two
servers.

The SPA build is `build/client/`. Every static host must fall back unknown document
requests to `index.html`; `nginx.conf` contains this rule. `/api` must be routed to
NestJS by the deployment ingress/reverse proxy. Vite supplies the equivalent proxy
in local development.

### Feature-oriented source tree (Multi-Role Enterprise Architecture)

SaaS-Sentry serves multiple user roles with distinct business capabilities:

- **Employee**: Self-service portal (my software, license requests, renewals, return seat).
- **IT Admin**: SaaS catalog, license seat inventory & allocation, vendor contracts, Shadow IT discovery.
- **Manager / Approver**: Approval inbox, team license overview, department spend.
- **Finance**: SaaS cost analysis, optimization recommendations, budget tracking.

To keep the codebase maintainable as the number of screens grows, routes and features are grouped by role/portal, while cross-role domain logic is shared through `entities/`:

```text
app/
  root.tsx                 document shell and error boundary
  routes.ts                route manifest defining nested layouts per role
  routes/                  thin route modules grouped by role/portal
    auth/                  login, sso-callback, forbidden
    employee/              employee portal routes (layout, dashboard, software, requests...)
    admin/                 IT admin portal routes (layout, catalog, licenses, contracts...)
    manager/               manager portal routes (layout, approvals...)
    finance/               finance portal routes (layout, cost-analytics...)
  providers/               root-only framework providers
  features/                business capabilities grouped by role/portal
    employee/              employee portal features (layout, dashboard, my-software, requests...)
    admin/                 IT admin portal features (layout, catalog, licenses, contracts...)
    manager/               manager portal features (layout, approvals...)
    finance/               finance portal features (layout, cost-optimization...)
    shared/                cross-role features (auth, profile-settings, notifications)
  entities/                domain presentation logic and models shared across roles
    license/               LicenseStatusBadge, LicenseCard, license domain types
    software/              SoftwareLogo, SoftwarePlanBadge, software domain types
    request/               RequestStatusBadge, ApprovalTimeline, request domain types
    user/                  UserAvatar, UserRoleBadge, user domain types
  shared/
    api/
      generated/
        api/<tag>/         fetch functions and TanStack Query hooks
        contracts/<tag>/   request/response/domain types
        mocks/<tag>/       Faker factories and MSW handlers
      query-client.ts       TanStack Query defaults
    config/                 validated public runtime/build configuration
    i18n/                   typed vi/en resources and language lifecycle
    lib/                    framework-neutral utilities
    ui/                     reusable presentation primitives (Button, Modal, Input, Table...)
test/                       global test setup
openapi/                    committed API contract snapshot
```

Folders are created when they gain a real member; empty taxonomy is not architecture.

Dependency rules are directional:

```text
routes -> features -> entities -> shared
providers -------------------------> shared
```

A lower layer cannot import a higher layer:

- A route module only renders its corresponding feature and configures loaders/meta.
- Features within one role do not import features from another role.
- Cross-role presentation or domain concepts MUST live in `entities/` (e.g. both Employee and Admin can import `LicenseStatusBadge` from `entities/license/`).
- Generic UI primitives and infrastructure live in `shared/ui/` and `shared/api/`.

### Role layouts and access control (RBAC)

1. **Dedicated Role Layouts**: Each role has its own layout shell (e.g., `features/employee/layout/employee-layout.tsx` for Employee, `features/admin/layout/admin-layout.tsx` for Admin). This ensures navigation items, headers, and quick actions are role-tailored without complex conditional logic in a single monolith layout.
2. **Layout-Level Route Guards**: Access control checks (e.g. verifying role permissions) run at the parent layout route module in `routes/<role>/layout.tsx`. Unauthorized users are intercepted before child route screens mount.

### Feature-internal organization

Each feature is self-contained. When a feature screen grows beyond a comfortable size, split it into focused files inside that feature folder:

```text
features/
  <role>/
    <feature>/
      <feature>-page.tsx              page component (~100 lines, composes children)
      components/                     feature-private child components
        <child-component>.tsx
      hooks/                          feature-private hooks
        use-<feature>-filters.ts
      __tests__/
        <feature>-page.test.tsx
```

Child components and hooks inside `components/` and `hooks/` are private to the
feature. Do not import them from other features. When a genuine second consumer
appears, promote the module to `entities/` (domain concept) or `shared/ui/`
(generic primitive).

#### Naming conventions

All file names use `kebab-case`. Exported symbols use their idiomatic JavaScript
casing (PascalCase for components, camelCase for hooks and functions).

| File type       | File name pattern            | Export pattern     | Example                                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Page/screen     | `<feature>-page.tsx`         | `<Feature>Page`    | `employee-dashboard-page.tsx` → `EmployeeDashboardPage` |
| Child component | `<description>.tsx`          | `<Description>`    | `software-table.tsx` → `SoftwareTable`                  |
| Hook            | `use-<description>.ts`       | `use<Description>` | `use-license-filters.ts` → `useLicenseFilters`          |
| Utility         | `<description>.ts`           | named exports      | `format-currency.ts` → `formatCurrency`                 |
| Type-only       | `<description>.types.ts`     | named exports      | `license.types.ts`                                      |
| Constants       | `<description>.constants.ts` | named exports      | `license.constants.ts`                                  |
| Test            | `<source-file>.test.tsx`     | —                  | `software-table.test.tsx`                               |

#### File size guideline

These are soft guidelines, not hard rules. Tailwind class names make JSX wider than
CSS-module equivalents, so the threshold is slightly generous.

| Lines   | Action                                                                  |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ≤ 150   | Ideal. Keep as-is.                                                      |
| 150–300 | Review: split if the file has two or more distinct responsibilities.    |
| > 300   | Split. A file this long almost certainly handles more than one concern. |

#### Splitting triggers

Beyond line count, split a component when any of these apply:

- The component owns two or more independent UI sections (table + filters + drawer).
- It accumulates more than four or five pieces of local state (`useState`,
  `useReducer`); extract a custom hook.
- A rendered list item has non-trivial logic of its own; extract an item component.
- The same markup or logic appears in two features; promote to `entities/` or
  `shared/ui/`.

### State ownership

- URL state: route params and search params.
- Remote state: TanStack Query keys, cache, mutations, invalidation, and retries.
- Form state: local to the feature/form until a chosen form library is justified.
- Ephemeral UI state: local component state; context only for a genuine subtree-wide
  concern.
- Auth and permissions: backend-authoritative; the client may derive display helpers
  from a returned session/permission model but cannot grant access.

Avoid copying query results into local state and avoid request calls in `useEffect`.
Use a route loader only when navigation itself needs the data or must redirect; use
`queryClient.ensureQueryData` with generated query options when loader prefetch is
introduced so Router and Query do not become competing caches.

### Contract-first client generation

`openapi/openapi.yaml` is a versioned snapshot consumed by `orval.config.ts`.
The current bootstrap operation mirrors the existing NestJS root controller; once
Swagger is enabled in the backend, the backend export replaces this bootstrap file.

```text
openapi/openapi.yaml
  -> pnpm api:validate
      -> enforce one declared tag per operation, unique operationId,
         *Request request bodies, and *Response success bodies
  -> pnpm api:generate
      -> app/shared/api/generated/api/<tag>
      -> app/shared/api/generated/contracts/<tag>
      -> app/shared/api/generated/mocks/<tag>/*.faker.ts
      -> app/shared/api/generated/mocks/<tag>/*.msw.ts
```

Orval uses `fetch`, `react-query`, and `tags-split`. `splitByTags` also places
contracts under their owning tag; a contract referenced by multiple tags remains at
the contracts root so it is not duplicated. `tagsSplitDeduplication` extracts shared
transport infrastructure, and generated index files provide deliberate public entry
points. Its base URL reads
`env.API_BASE_URL`, which defaults to `/api`. The built-in fetch generator preserves
typed response data/status and throws for non-success HTTP responses, allowing
TanStack Query to enter its error state. Do not wrap every generated call in a
repository. Add a custom fetch mutator only when authentication, refresh, correlation
IDs, or a normalized API-error contract requires it.

Faker is a development dependency and may be used by unit tests, component examples,
or deterministic fixtures. MSW handlers may be used by integration tests or an
explicit local mock mode. Neither is imported by the production app graph.

Mock data does use Orval: Faker generators create typed object factories from schema
constraints/examples, while MSW generators wrap those factories as HTTP handlers.
Use Faker when code needs a typed object without a network boundary; use MSW when the
test must exercise loading/error/cache/request behavior. Override generated defaults
inside the test instead of editing generated mock files.

Tag and contract naming is what creates the folder architecture. Backend Swagger
must declare exactly one stable business tag such as `Users`, `Licenses`, or
`Approval Workflows` on every operation. Request bodies reference names such as
`CreateUserRequest`; successful bodies reference wrappers such as `UserResponse` or
`UsersPageResponse`. Reusable inner objects use semantic names such as `UserDto`,
`MoneyDto`, or `LicenseStatus`. Orval cannot reliably infer whether an ambiguously
named DTO is a request or response, so `api:validate` rejects ambiguous top-level body
names before generation.

### Localization as a source boundary

`app/shared/i18n/resources.ts` is the source of truth for Vietnamese and English UI
copy. i18next is initialized with Vietnamese as the deterministic build/hydration
fallback; after mounting, a stored choice or supported browser language is applied.
The switch updates i18next, `<html lang>`, and browser storage.

Translation keys describe meaning (`licenses.empty.title`), not source text
(`noLicensesFound`). Both languages are changed atomically. UI components own
layout, while resources own sentences; do not split sentences into translated
fragments because grammar and word order differ. API-provided business data is kept
as data. Backend error codes should be mapped to frontend translation keys at the
feature boundary rather than displaying backend English text directly.

ESLint's local `project/no-hardcoded-ui-text` rule covers literal JSX text and common
visible/accessibility attributes. It intentionally does not guess every string in
ordinary TypeScript, so code review still checks alerts, schema validation messages,
table metadata, and third-party component props. `Intl` handles locale-aware dates,
numbers, currencies, percentages, and lists.

Contract update workflow:

1. Export OpenAPI from the backend and review the contract diff.
2. Replace `openapi/openapi.yaml`.
3. Run `pnpm api:generate`.
4. Fix feature code against generated types; never patch generated output.
5. Run `pnpm check` and commit contract plus generated output together.

### Configuration

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is public and defaults to `/api`.
- `API_PROXY_TARGET` is read only by the Vite development server and defaults to
  `http://localhost:3000`.
- Vite statically replaces browser environment values during the build. A changed
  production API prefix therefore requires a rebuild unless the deployment keeps the
  stable `/api` ingress contract.
- No token, private key, or service credential belongs in a `VITE_*` variable.

### Testing and debugging

`vitest.config.ts` is exclusively the test-runner configuration. It limits discovery
to authored app tests, uses jsdom so DOM/accessibility behavior is available, loads
`test/setup.ts`, and reuses TypeScript path aliases. It does not configure the
production bundle; React Router/Vite build behavior lives in `vite.config.ts` and
`react-router.config.ts`.

The minimum test pyramid is:

1. Pure unit tests for formatting, mapping, and permission-display helpers.
2. Feature/component tests with Testing Library and generated Faker factories.
3. Request integration tests with generated MSW handlers where network behavior
   matters.
4. Browser smoke tests for navigation, console, accessibility tree, and important
   network requests.

Generated API output is TypeScript-checked but not hand-linted as authored code.
Failures should be fixed in the OpenAPI document or Orval configuration.

### Deployment files: VPS/Docker versus Vercel

The two deployment paths share the same static `build/client` output but use
different adapters:

- Docker/VPS: the final image copies `build/client` into Nginx. `nginx.conf` serves
  static assets and uses `try_files ... /index.html` so a hard refresh on a client
  route still boots React Router. A deployment ingress must route `/api` to NestJS,
  or the frontend must be built with a public absolute API URL.
- Vercel: Nginx and `nginx.conf` are not used. `react-router.config.ts` contains the
  official Vercel preset and keeps `ssr: false`; Vercel supports React Router SPA
  builds without a custom server. Configure the Vercel project root as `Code/FE-web`
  (when deploying this parent repository), keep the pnpm install/build commands, and
  set public environment values in the Vercel project before building. Test a deep
  route in Preview, not only `/`.

Do not add a broad Vercel rewrite on top of the React Router preset unless an actual
preview proves it is necessary; generic Vite SPAs need an `index.html` rewrite, while
the official React Router preset already understands the route/build structure.

### Why `openapi/` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` exist

`openapi/` contains a reviewed snapshot of the backend's machine-readable contract.
Committing it makes backend changes diffable, generation reproducible offline, and
frontend/CI behavior independent of a live Swagger server. The backend remains the
author; clients replace the snapshot, validate it, regenerate, and commit the
contract plus output together.

`pnpm-workspace.yaml` declares the workspace root even with one package. Omitting a
`packages` list means only this root package participates today, while the file is
also the canonical place for pnpm resolution, supply-chain, and dependency build
policy. `allowBuilds` permits install scripts only for named packages such as
`esbuild` and `msw`; adding a package there grants code execution during install and
requires review. It is not evidence that this repository is already a monorepo and
does not require creating empty packages.

## Deferred decisions

- Authentication/session storage awaits the backend OIDC contract. Do not store
  long-lived tokens in local storage by default.
- Form, table, chart, and component libraries should be chosen from real screens and
  accessibility requirements, not installed as architecture placeholders.
- A shared Web/Mobile package is deferred. Web is the MVP and native presentation
  constraints differ; share the API contract and domain language before sharing UI.
