# SaaS-Sentry Web agent guide

This file is the operational source of truth for humans and coding agents working
in this repository. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` before changing structure or data flow.

## Product scope

- This repository is the production frontend for the SaaS-Sentry MVP.
- The BRD is at
  `../../Docs/Requiments/BRD - HỆ THỐNG QUẢN TRỊ BẢN QUYỀN PHẦN MỀM & TỐI ƯU CHI PHÍ CÔNG NGHỆ.md`.
- The product is a responsive B2B web application. NestJS owns business rules,
  authorization, persistence, jobs, and the authoritative OpenAPI contract.

## Stack

- React 19 and React Router 8 in Framework Mode with SPA rendering
- Vite 8 and Tailwind CSS 4
- TanStack Query 5 for remote/server state
- Orval 8 for OpenAPI client, hook, Faker factory, and MSW handler generation
- Vitest and Testing Library
- TypeScript strict mode, ESLint flat config, Prettier, pnpm

For React Router work, also read `.agents/skills/react-router/SKILL.md` and its
Framework Mode reference. Do not apply Data or Declarative Mode patterns here.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm api:validate
pnpm api:generate
pnpm dev
pnpm test
pnpm check
```

Run `pnpm api:generate` after every `openapi/openapi.yaml` change. Before handing
off a change, run the smallest relevant check and then `pnpm check` for a complete
feature or architecture change.

## Source boundaries

```text
app/routes      URL, metadata, navigation, route loaders/actions
app/providers   root framework providers
app/features    user-facing business capabilities
app/entities    reusable domain concepts, created only when needed
app/shared      configuration, API, UI primitives, utilities, test support
```

Allowed dependency direction:

```text
routes -> features -> entities -> shared
   |          |                     ^
   +----------+---------------------+
providers --------------------------+
```

- A route module must stay thin. Move reusable rendering and workflows to a feature.
- A feature must not import another feature's internals. Promote genuinely shared
  domain concepts to `entities/` or generic code to `shared/`.
- `shared/` must never import from `features/`, `entities/`, or `routes/`.
- Do not create barrels that hide dependency cycles.
- Do not add an abstraction until there is a concrete second consumer or framework
  boundary that requires it.

## Mandatory file-placement rules

Use this table before creating a file. AI-generated code that lands in the wrong
layer must be moved before the task is considered complete.

| Code being added                        | Required location                         | Must not contain                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| URL registration                        | `app/routes.ts`                           | UI, fetching, business rules                     |
| Route metadata/params/redirect/prefetch | `app/routes/<route>.tsx`                  | Reusable page layout or feature workflow         |
| Full route-level UI                     | `app/features/<feature>/pages/*-page.tsx` | Router manifest declarations                     |
| Feature-only UI piece                   | `app/features/<feature>/components/*.tsx` | Generic app-wide primitives                      |
| Feature orchestration hook              | `app/features/<feature>/hooks/use-*.ts`   | Raw `fetch`, translated JSX, unrelated features  |
| Feature mapper/view model               | `app/features/<feature>/model/*.ts`       | React or browser APIs when a pure function works |
| Reusable domain display logic           | `app/entities/<entity>/`                  | One-feature workflow logic                       |
| Generic UI primitive                    | `app/shared/ui/`                          | License/user/approval-specific behavior          |
| Generic utility/config                  | `app/shared/lib/`, `app/shared/config/`   | Imports from routes/features/entities            |
| Generated client/types/mocks            | `app/shared/api/generated/`               | Hand edits                                       |

A small feature may start flat with `home-page.tsx` and its test. Once it has more
than one page, hook, component, or model, use the full shape below; do not accumulate
ten unrelated files at the feature root.

```text
app/features/licenses/
  index.ts                         public exports only
  pages/licenses-page.tsx          route-level composition
  pages/license-details-page.tsx
  components/license-card.tsx      feature-only presentation
  components/license-filters.tsx
  hooks/use-license-list.ts         query + feature orchestration
  hooks/use-license-filters.ts      URL/filter interaction
  model/license-list.model.ts       pure mapping/types
  components/license-card.test.tsx
  pages/licenses-page.test.tsx
```

Other features import only `~/features/licenses`, never
`~/features/licenses/components/license-card`. Routes also prefer the feature's
public `index.ts`. Do not create a barrel for `shared/` or the whole application.
See the complete code example in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Data and API rules

- Remote state belongs in TanStack Query. Do not fetch remote data from ad-hoc
  `useEffect` calls.
- React Router loaders/actions are for URL-dependent orchestration, redirects, and
  critical prefetch; they are not a second cache.
- `openapi/openapi.yaml` is the committed frontend snapshot of the backend contract.
- Everything below `app/shared/api/generated/` is generated. Never edit it by hand.
- Every operation must have exactly one declared OpenAPI tag and a unique
  `operationId`. Request body components end in `Request`; successful response
  components end in `Response`. `pnpm api:validate` enforces this before Orval runs.
- Generated output is organized as `api/<tag>` (fetch functions/query hooks),
  `contracts/<tag>` (request/response/domain types), and `mocks/<tag>`
  (Faker factories and MSW handlers). Cross-tag types remain at the contracts root.
- Import Faker factories or MSW handlers only from tests, stories, or explicit dev
  tooling. Never import them into production route/feature code.
- `VITE_*` values are public in browser bundles. Never store secrets there.
- Authorization decisions must be enforced by the backend even when the UI hides an
  action based on role.

## Localization rules

- Vietnamese (`vi`) and English (`en`) are supported through typed i18next resources
  in `app/shared/i18n/`. A component renders copy with `t('namespace.key')`; it does
  not contain a Vietnamese or English UI literal.
- This applies to headings, buttons, empty/error/loading states, tooltips,
  placeholders, `alt`, `title`, `aria-label`, validation messages, toasts, and modal
  copy. Brand/domain data returned by the API is not translated unless the contract
  explicitly models a translation key.
- Add the key to both `resources.vi` and `resources.en` in the same change. Do not use
  an English string as a translation key.
- `project/no-hardcoded-ui-text` blocks literal JSX and accessibility copy. The rule
  is a guardrail, not permission to hide literals in variables; reviews must reject
  user-visible copy outside the i18n layer.
- Persisted browser preference uses `localStorage`; `vi` is the deterministic
  build/hydration fallback. Dates, currencies, percentages, and numbers use `Intl`
  with the active locale.

## Configuration file map

- `vitest.config.ts` configures test discovery, the jsdom browser-like environment,
  global setup, and path resolution. It is not a production/Vite build config.
- `nginx.conf` serves `build/client` in the Docker/VPS image and falls back unknown
  routes to `index.html`. Vercel does not read this file.
- `react-router.config.ts` selects SPA rendering and enables the official Vercel
  preset. On Vercel set the project root to this package; the preset handles the
  React Router build. Keep `/api` on a reachable backend/ingress.
- `openapi/` stores the reviewed, versioned backend contract snapshot consumed by
  Orval; it is input, not handwritten frontend DTO code.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` marks this package as a pnpm workspace root and centralizes
  dependency-resolution/build-script policy even though it currently has one
  package. `allowBuilds` is an explicit supply-chain allowlist; do not broaden it
  casually.

## Quality rules

- Preserve strict TypeScript; do not introduce `any` to bypass a contract.
- Add behavior-focused tests next to features. Prefer accessible queries.
- Keep a clean browser console and verify changed routes in a real browser.
- Keep loading, empty, error, and permission-denied states explicit for API screens.
- Do not manually edit `pnpm-lock.yaml`; change dependencies through pnpm.
- Do not commit `.env`, build output, coverage, or generated React Router types.
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` when changing a boundary, public interface, rendering
  model, API generation policy, or deployment assumption.
- A page/screen is composition; a component is presentation; a hook is stateful
  orchestration; a model is pure data transformation. Do not put all four jobs in
  one 300-line component.
- Before adding a new helper, search for an existing equivalent. Before promoting
  code to `shared`, identify at least two real consumers and remove domain naming.
- Refactor AI output in the same task: split mixed responsibilities, remove duplicate
  fetching/state, replace hardcoded copy with i18n keys, and add behavior tests. A
  passing render with known structural debt is not "done".

## AI workflow

1. Read this file and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
2. Inspect the nearest feature, its public `index.ts`, generated API export, and tests
   before editing. Search before inventing a new pattern.
3. Write the target file tree in the task plan for any feature touching three or more
   authored files; assign every file one responsibility.
4. State any assumption that changes product behavior or access control.
5. Make one vertical slice: route -> page -> hook/model -> component -> test. Generate
   rather than hand-edit API code.
6. Re-read the diff specifically for oversized components, cross-feature private
   imports, duplicate API wrappers, `useEffect` fetching, hardcoded copy, and `any`.
7. Run relevant checks and report exact results plus any remaining risk.
